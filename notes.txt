### Ansible Automation Lab ###

# Introduction

- What?
  - Automation and orchestration framework

- Why?
  - automate routine tasks like configuration deployment, data collection, verification

- How?
  - Executes tasks called "modules" in an order specified in a "playbook" against 1 or many hosts

# Install (Make sure you update PPA (Personal Package Archive for Ansible repo to get latest modules!!!!)
  - Install required packages for Ansible
    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
    sudo apt-get update
    apt-get install ansible
    ansible --version
    python --version

  - Download Opticore Ansible Lab repository from github
    git clone https://github.com/opticore/auto-lab2.git

# Ansible Configuration File
  - Used for global settings
  - http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_configuration.html
  - Can be modified with local instance
    - update only those parameters you want to change

  global : /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  local e.g : /ansible_lab/ansible.cfg

  Some recommendations:
  - SSH Library : change from OpenSSH (default) to paramiko which is better at handleing SSH connections to Cisco devices
    - Netmiko & NAPLAM extends paramiko lib
    - Paramiko is a standard lib so should be included with your default python implementation
  - hostfile : specify the list of hosts to be managed by your ansible script.
    - Its probably going to be preferable to reference a local instance of hosts rather than global
  - SSH Key host_key_checking
    - Key checking validated the remote host you connect to is the same as the one you connect to last time.
      - Used to prevent MIM attacks
      - Will prevent/prompt if there is a change in signature, some scripts my not handle this exception.
      - Sometimes its desirable to turn this off (e.g Dev) or hangle unknown exceptions.
      - ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  - timeout (sec)
    - deduced from default (10s) for dev

# Ansible Inventory hostfile
    global : /etc/ansible/hosts
    local e.g : /ansible_lab/lab_hosts  # This can be whatever you like

    - Contains the list of remote hosts to be managed by ansible. Can use IP, FDQN or Reference to variable reference to hosts_var
    - Can be grouped using [] e.g [lab_devices]
    - Commands are executed against hosts in parallel
    - Variables must be defined to set connection parameters for each host (IP, username, pass etc)
    - Considered best practice to keep all variable in separate folders
      - Uses a fixed relative refernce to hosts_vars
      - BAD practice to keep files in clear text
      - Add hosts_vars to .gitignore so it does not get published

  !!! TASK 1 - Test an Adhoc Command
    - Execute a test command using raw module and user provided credentials.

      un/pw/priv : cisco/cisco/cisco
      devices : { IOU1 : 10.0.0.11 , IOU1 : 10.0.0.12 , IOU1 : 10.0.0.13]

      ansible lab-devices -u cisco -m raw -a "ping 10.0.0.1 source eth0/0 df-bit size 1500"
      ansible lab-devices -u cisco -m raw -a "ping 10.0.0.1 source eth0/0 df-bit size 1501"
      ansible lab-devices -u cisco -m raw -a "ping 10.0.0.1 source eth0/0 df-bit size 1500 wrong_param"


  !!! TASK 2 - Turn this into a playbook
  - Our First playbook (ios_command.yml)

    ansible-playbook .yml
    ansible-playbook ios_command.yml       # Add another play by uncommenting sh run play
    ansible-playbook ios_command.yml -v    # Add Verbosity
    ansible-playbook ios_command.yml       # uncomment variable's run again

    add another command   # Add another item to the commands: list        # - show version
    access first/second element of registered variable                    #      debug: msg="{{ show_output.stdout_lines[1] }}"

  !!! TASK 3 - Add another Task
    - Our Second playbook (ios_sh_run_write.yml)
    - Here we add another task, we write the output to a file

      ansible-playbook ios_sh_run_write.yml     # Why are we referencing an element in an array?

  !!! TASK 3 - Configure Devices
    - Our Third playbook (ios_configure.yml)
    - use 'ios_config' module
    - group_vars : Common across all hosts
    - If using common creds you add your provider to group_vars, in our instance 'all.yml'
    - use --check to perform a 'dry-run' and -v to add details of proposed changes
    - ios_config can use command lines, cfg or template

    - Use Jinja2 Template library to make .cfg files from .j2 template & .yml or .csv
    - Push Configuration Files to Devices

  !!! TASK 4 - Secure your Credentials!
    - Storing Credentials in plain text is not big or clever!

      ansible-vault encrypt host_vars/IOU1
      ansible-vault encrypt host_vars/IOU2
      ansible-vault encrypt host_vars/IOU3

      ansible-playbook â€“ask-vault-pass ios_command.yml

    - Update .gitignore so your var files are not pushed to your git repository when you update

      'touch .gitignore' 
      add the line 'host_vars/'
